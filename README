Set-up docker
sudo apt-get install docker.io

Navigate to the folder openvidu_extras
Run script.sh with ./script.sh

This will setup a server on your machine.
In the strings.xml file, replace the IP Address with your machine's IP Address.
For example,    <string name="default_openvidu_url">https://192.168.0.8:4443/</string> 192.168.0.8 is my system's IP Address.

Build the app and run it.
